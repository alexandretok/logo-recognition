# Logo recognition with C++ and OpenCV

This is a course project for the Digital Image Processing class of 2016.2 at UFRN, Brazil.

The application's objective is to search for registered company logos inside a number of images.

I'll be adding compiling instructions, some screenshots and a video soon.
